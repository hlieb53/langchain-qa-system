        "question": "Local Supply Chain - detail how you will engage with the local supply chain to demonstrate what percentage of materials are locally sourced and how this is measured",
        "answer": "MCP are keen to support our clients in growing the local economy and we have worked very hard to develop long-term partnerships on our contracts. Our approach on this contract is to create a balance between employing subcontractors that are large enough to deliver the requirements of this contract but encourage smaller SMEs. We have an operational supply chain that serves the local region, the national suppliers with open accounts include Travis Perkins, Jewsons, Nicholls and Clark and Wolseley Group who provide us with regular reports on material usage and local materials uses. We have already actively engaged with our potential local supply chain partners during the tender process who are keen to support us on this contract. During mobilisation, MCP will involve our supply chain partners at mobilisation workshops to promote the contract and to provide details of the requirements."
